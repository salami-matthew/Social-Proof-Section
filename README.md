## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge helped reinforce my knowledge of flexbox and working with layouts on a webpage, as well as using media queries for responsive web design. I was also able to get a better feel of the use of margins, paddings and spacing generally using px,rem and %.


### Continued development

I would still like to learn more on using css grids together with flexbox as I try more challenges
